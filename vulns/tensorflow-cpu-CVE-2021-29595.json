    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of the `DepthToSpace` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depth_to_space.cc#L63-L69). An attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of the `DepthToSpace` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depth_to_space.cc#L63-L69):\n\n```cc\nconst int block_size = params->block_size;\n...\nconst int input_channels = input->dims->data[3];\n... \nint output_channels = input_channels / block_size / block_size;\n``` \n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` is 0.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9).\n    \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
