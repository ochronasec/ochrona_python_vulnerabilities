The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` is vulnerable to a division by 0. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/279bab6efa22752a2827621b7edb56a730233bd8/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1033-L1034) fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero, before dividing by this quantity. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` is vulnerable to a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\ngrad = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nargmax = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\nksize = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\ntf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax(\n  input=input, grad=grad, argmax=argmax, ksize=ksize, strides=strides,\n  padding='SAME', include_batch_in_index=False)\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/279bab6efa22752a2827621b7edb56a730233bd8/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1033-L1034) fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero, before dividing by this quantity.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [376c352a37ce5a68b721406dc7e77ac4b6cf483d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/376c352a37ce5a68b721406dc7e77ac4b6cf483d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
