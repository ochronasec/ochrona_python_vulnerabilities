    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of the `Split` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e2752089ef7ce9bcf3db0ec618ebd23ea119d0c7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split.cc#L63-L65). An attacker can craft a model such that `num_splits` would be 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of the `Split` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e2752089ef7ce9bcf3db0ec618ebd23ea119d0c7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split.cc#L63-L65):\n\n```cc\nTF_LITE_ENSURE_MSG(context, input_size % num_splits == 0, \"Not an even split\");\nconst int slice_size = input_size / num_splits;\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that `num_splits` would be 0.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b22786e7e9b7bdb6a56936ff29cc7e9968d7bc1d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b22786e7e9b7bdb6a56936ff29cc7e9968d7bc1d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
