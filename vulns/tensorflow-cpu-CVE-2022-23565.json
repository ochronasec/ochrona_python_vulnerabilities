An attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
