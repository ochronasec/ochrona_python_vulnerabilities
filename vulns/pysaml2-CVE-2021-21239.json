    "description": "From NVD:\nPySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature.\n\n\nThis is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default, `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue has been reported in the past at the xmlsec1 mailing list:\nhttps://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2013/009717.html\n\n### Credits\n\n- Brian Wolff\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)",
