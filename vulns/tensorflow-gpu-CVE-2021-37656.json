    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_sparse_kernel.cc#L30) has an incomplete validation of the splits values: it does not check that they are in increasing order. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse(\n rt_nested_splits=[[0, 38, 0]],\n rt_dense_values=[])\n```\n \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_sparse_kernel.cc#L30) has an incomplete validation of the splits values: it does not check that they are in increasing order.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.
