This is low-severity issue as the attacker needs to be aware of certain parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some metadata about a DAG and a Task. This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.\nFrom Github:\nThe lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API was not protected by authentication in Airflow 2.0.0.
