    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f6fe4dfef6f57e768260b48166c27d148f3015f/tensorflow/core/kernels/parameterized_truncated_normal_op.cc#L630) does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`. If `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat<T>()` is an empty array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n    \nshape = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int32)\nmeans = tf.constant((1), dtype=tf.float32)\nstdevs = tf.constant((1), dtype=tf.float32)\nminvals = tf.constant((1), dtype=tf.float32)\nmaxvals = tf.constant((1), dtype=tf.float32)\n  \ntf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal(\n  shape=shape, means=means, stdevs=stdevs, minvals=minvals, maxvals=maxvals)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f6fe4dfef6f57e768260b48166c27d148f3015f/tensorflow/core/kernels/parameterized_truncated_normal_op.cc#L630) does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`:\n\n```cc\nint32 num_batches = shape_tensor.flat<int32>()(0);\n``` \n\nIf `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat<T>()` is an empty array.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5e52ef5a461570cfb68f3bdbbebfe972cb4e0fd8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5e52ef5a461570cfb68f3bdbbebfe972cb4e0fd8).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
