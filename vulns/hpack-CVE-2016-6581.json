This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.", "latest_version": "3.0.0", "language": "python", "license": "MIT", "repository_summary": "HTTP/2 Header Encoding for Python http://python-hyper.org/hpack/", "repo_url": "https://github.com/python-hyper/hpack", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 7.8, "cvss2_severity": "HIGH", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "NONE", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 3.9, "cvss3_score": 7.5, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.5}
