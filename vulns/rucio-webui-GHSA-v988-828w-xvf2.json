    "description": "### Impact\n`rucio-webui` installations of the `1.26` release line potentially leak the contents of cookies to other sessions within a wsgi container. Impact is that Rucio authentication tokens are leaked to other users accessing the `webui` within a close timeframe, thus allowing users to access the `webui` with the leaked authentication token. Privileges are therefore also escalated.\n\nRucio server / daemons are not affected by this issue, it is isolated to the webui.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in the `1.26.7` release of the `rucio-webui`.\n\n### Workarounds\nInstallation of the `1.25.7` `webui` release. The `1.25` and previous webui release lines are not affected by this issue.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/4928",
