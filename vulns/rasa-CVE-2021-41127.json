    "description": "From NVD:\nRasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in the functionality that loads a trained model `tar.gz` file which allows a malicious actor to craft a `model.tar.gz` file which can overwrite or replace bot files in the bot directory. The vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10. For users unable to update ensure that users do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) vulnerability in the functionality that allows a user to load a trained model archive in Rasa 2.8.9 and older allows an attacker arbitrary write capability within specific directories using a malicious crafted archive file.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10\n\n### Workarounds\nMitigating steps for vulnerable end users are to ensure that they do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email [the Rasa Security Team](mailto:security@rasa.com)\n",
