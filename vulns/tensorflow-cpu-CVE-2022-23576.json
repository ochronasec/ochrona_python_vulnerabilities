    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve tensors with large enough number of elements. We can have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in the multiplication. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe [implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc#L1598-L1617) is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve tensors with large enough number of elements:\n```cc\nfor (const auto& dim : output_shape.dim()) {\n  output_size *= dim.size();\n} \n```\n  \nHere, we can have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in the multiplication.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b9bd6cfd1c50e6807846af9a86f9b83cafc9c8ae](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b9bd6cfd1c50e6807846af9a86f9b83cafc9c8ae).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
