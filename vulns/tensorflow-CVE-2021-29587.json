    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator does not check for 0 before division(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc#L63-L67). An attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` would be zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator [does not check for 0 before division](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc#L63-L67).\n\n```cc \nconst int block_size = params->block_size;\nconst int input_height = input->dims->data[1];\nconst int input_width = input->dims->data[2];\nint output_height = input_height / block_size;\nint output_width = input_width / block_size;\n```   \n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` would be zero.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
