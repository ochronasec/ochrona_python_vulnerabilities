By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.\n\n### Patches\nThis exploit has been fixed on version & ``3.4.1``.\n\n### Workarounds\nUnloading the Mod module with ``unload mod`` __or__, disabling the ``massban`` command with ``command disable global massban`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to ``3.4.1`` to completely patch this issue.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/commit/726bfd38adfdfaef760412a68e01447b470f438b\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)\n* Over on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/red)", "latest_version": "3.4.2", "language": "python", "license": "GPL-3.0-only", "repository_summary": "A highly customisable Discord bot", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot", "impact": {"cvss3_score": null, "cvss3_severity": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "pr": null, "ui": null, "s": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "impact_score": null, "exploitability_score": null}, "ochrona_severity_score": 5}
