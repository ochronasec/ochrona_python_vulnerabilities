    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Passing a complex argument to `tf.transpose` at the same time as passing `conjugate=True` argument results in a crash. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nPassing a complex argument to `tf.transpose` at the same time as passing `conjugate=True` argument results in a crash:\n\n```python \nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.transpose(conjugate=True, a=complex(1))\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit [1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
