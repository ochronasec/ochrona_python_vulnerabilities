A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).\n\n### Workarounds\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable the revision comparison view by adding the following URL route to the top of their project's `urls.py` configuration:\n\n    from django.views.generic.base import RedirectView\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        url(r'^admin/pages/(\\d+)/revisions/compare/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/admin/')),\n        # ...\n    ]\n\n### Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Vlad Gerasimenko for reporting this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Visit Wagtail's [support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html)\n* Email us at [security@wagtail.io](mailto:security@wagtail.io) (if you wish to send encrypted email, the public key ID is `0x6ba1e1a86e0f8ce8`)", "latest_version": "2.11.1", "language": "python", "license": "BSD-3-Clause", "repository_summary": "A Django content management system.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 3.5, "cvss2_severity": "LOW", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "HIGH", "i": "NONE", "a": "NONE", "impact_score": 4.0, "exploitability_score": 2.3, "cvss3_score": 6.8, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "REQUIRED", "s": "CHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 6.8}
