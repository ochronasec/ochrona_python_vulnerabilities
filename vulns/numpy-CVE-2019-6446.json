It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.", "latest_version": "1.17.4", "language": "python", "license": "BSD-3-Clause", "repository_summary": "NumPy is the fundamental package for array computing with Python.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/numpy/numpy", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 7.5, "cvss2_severity": "HIGH", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "NONE", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.9, "exploitability_score": 3.9, "cvss3_score": 9.8, "cvss3_severity": "CRITICAL", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 9.8}
