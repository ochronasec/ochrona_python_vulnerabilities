The implementation of `MapStage` is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact \nThe [implementation of `MapStage`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L519-L550) is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.raw_ops.MapStage(\n    key = tf.constant(value=[4], shape= (1,2), dtype=tf.int64),\n    indices = np.array([[6]]),\n    values = np.array([-60]),\n    dtypes = [tf.int64], capacity=0, memory_limit=0,\n    container='', shared_name='', name=None\n)   \n``` \n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f57315566d7094f322b784947093406c2aea0d7d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f57315566d7094f322b784947093406c2aea0d7d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
