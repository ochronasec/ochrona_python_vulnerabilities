    "description": "From NVD:\nOMERO.web provides a web based client and plugin infrastructure. In versions prior to 5.11.0, a variety of templates do not perform proper sanitization through HTML escaping. Due to the lack of sanitization and use of ``jQuery.html()``, there are a whole host of cross-site scripting possibilities with specially crafted input to a variety of fields. This issue is patched in version 5.11.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\nFrom Github:\n### Background\n\nA variety of templates do not perform proper sanitization through HTML escaping.\nDue to the lack of sanitization and use of ``jQuery.html()``, there are a whole host of XSS possibilities with specially crafted input to a variety of fields.\n\n### Impact\n\nOMERO.web before 5.11.0 and OMERO.figure before 4.4.1.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade OMERO.web to 5.11.0 or higher and OMERO.figure to 4.4.1 or higher.",
