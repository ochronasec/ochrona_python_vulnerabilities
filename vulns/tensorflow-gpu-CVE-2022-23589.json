There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one would trigger the same dereference in the second place):\n\nFirst, during [constant folding](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc#L3466-L3497), the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation:\n\n```cc\n  NodeDef* mul_left_child = node_map_->GetNode(node->input(0));\n  NodeDef* mul_right_child = node_map_->GetNode(node->input(1));\n  // One child must be constant, and the second must be Conv op.\n  const bool left_child_is_constant = IsReallyConstant(*mul_left_child);\n  const bool right_child_is_constant = IsReallyConstant(*mul_right_child);\n```\n\nIf a node is missing, the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line would be incorrect.\n\nWe have a similar issue during [`IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/mutable_graph_view.cc#L59-L74):\n\n```cc\n  NodeDef* input_node = graph.GetNode(tensor_id.node());\n  return IsSwitch(*input_node);\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [0a365c029e437be0349c31f8d4c9926b69fa3fa1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0a365c029e437be0349c31f8d4c9926b69fa3fa1) and [045deec1cbdebb27d817008ad5df94d96a08b1bf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/045deec1cbdebb27d817008ad5df94d96a08b1bf).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
