The implementation of `MatrixTriangularSolve`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8cae746d8449c7dda5298327353d68613f16e798/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_triangular_solve_op_impl.h#L160-L240) fails to terminate kernel execution if one validation condition fails. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of [`MatrixTriangularSolve`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8cae746d8449c7dda5298327353d68613f16e798/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_triangular_solve_op_impl.h#L160-L240) fails to terminate kernel execution if one validation condition fails:\n\n```cc\nvoid ValidateInputTensors(OpKernelContext* ctx, const Tensor& in0,\n                            const Tensor& in1) override {\n  OP_REQUIRES(\n      ctx, in0.dims() >= 2,\n      errors::InvalidArgument(\"In[0] ndims must be >= 2: \", in0.dims()));\n\n  OP_REQUIRES(\n      ctx, in1.dims() >= 2,\n      errors::InvalidArgument(\"In[0] ndims must be >= 2: \", in1.dims()));\n}\n  \nvoid Compute(OpKernelContext* ctx) override {\n  const Tensor& in0 = ctx->input(0);\n  const Tensor& in1 = ctx->input(1);\n\n  ValidateInputTensors(ctx, in0, in1);\n\n  MatMulBCast bcast(in0.shape().dim_sizes(), in1.shape().dim_sizes());\n  ...\n}\n```\n  \nSince `OP_REQUIRES` only sets `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value and calls `return`, this allows malicious attackers to trigger an out of bounds read:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\nmatrix_array = np.array([])\nmatrix_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(matrix_array,(1,0)),dtype=tf.float32)\nrhs_array = np.array([])\nrhs_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(rhs_array,(0,1)),dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.MatrixTriangularSolve(matrix=matrix_tensor,rhs=rhs_tensor,lower=False,adjoint=False)\n```\n\nAs the two input tensors are empty, the `OP_REQUIRES` in `ValidateInputTensors` should fire and interrupt execution. However, given the implementation of `OP_REQUIRES`, after the `in0.dims() >= 2` fails, execution moves to the initialization of the `bcast` object. This initialization is done with invalid data and results in heap OOB read.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [480641e3599775a8895254ffbc0fc45621334f68](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/480641e3599775a8895254ffbc0fc45621334f68).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ye Zhang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://www.tensorflow.org/", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 2.1, "cvss2_severity": "LOW", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "av": "LOCAL", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 1.8, "cvss3_score": 5.5, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 5.5}
