    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of `Split_V`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99). If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the `SizeOfDimension` function(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nA specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of [`Split_V`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99):\n\n```cc\nconst int input_size = SizeOfDimension(input, axis_value);\n``` \n\nIf `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the [`SizeOfDimension` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array:\n\n```cc\ninline int SizeOfDimension(const TfLiteTensor* t, int dim) {\n  return t->dims->data[dim];\n}\n```\n  \n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
