    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The fix for CVE-2020-15209(https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209) missed the case when the target shape of `Reshape` operator is given by the elements of a 1-D tensor. As such, the fix for the vulnerability(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L1062-L1074) allowed passing a null-buffer-backed tensor with a 1D shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe fix for [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209) missed the case when the target shape of `Reshape` operator is given by the elements of a 1-D tensor. As such, the [fix for the vulnerability](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L1062-L1074) allowed passing a null-buffer-backed tensor with a 1D shape:\n\n```cc\nif (tensor->data.raw == nullptr && tensor->bytes > 0) {\n  if (registration.builtin_code == kTfLiteBuiltinReshape && i == 1) {\n    // In general, having a tensor here with no buffer will be an error.\n    // However, for the reshape operator, the second input tensor is only\n    // used for the shape, not for the data. Thus, null buffer is ok.\n    continue;\n  } else {\n    // In all other cases, we need to return an error as otherwise we will\n    // trigger a null pointer dereference (likely).\n    ReportError(\"Input tensor %d lacks data\", tensor_index);\n    return kTfLiteError;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f8378920345f4f4604202d4ab15ef64b2aceaa16](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f8378920345f4f4604202d4ab15ef64b2aceaa16).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
