However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area. If the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault. This is because the allocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the needed virtual method is not overridden. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operation returns a constant tensor created from a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable. However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area:\n\n```python\n>>> import tensorflow as tf\n>>> with open('/tmp/test.txt','w') as f: f.write('a'*128)\n>>> tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=2,\n memory_region_name='/tmp/test.txt')\n```\n\nIf the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault.\n\nThis is because the alocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the [needed virtual method](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7/tensorflow/core/framework/typed_allocator.h#L78-L85) is [not overriden](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acdf3c04fcfa767ae8d109b9e1f727ef050dba4d/tensorflow/core/kernels/immutable_constant_op.cc).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7) and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.\n\nSince this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 3.6, "cvss2_severity": "LOW", "av": "LOCAL", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "NONE", "i": "LOW", "a": "LOW", "impact_score": 2.5, "exploitability_score": 1.8, "cvss3_score": 4.4, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 4.4}
