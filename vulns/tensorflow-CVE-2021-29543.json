An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder`.

When this condition is false, the program aborts, instead of returning a valid error to the user. This abnormal termination can be weaponized in denial of service attacks.\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
