When building an XLA compilation cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null pointer dereference. In the default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto` is `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nWhen [building an XLA compilation cache](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/compiler/jit/xla_platform_info.cc#L43-L104), if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null pointer dereference:\n\n```cc \n  string allowed_gpus =\n      flr->config_proto()->gpu_options().visible_device_list();\n``` \n    \nIn the default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto` is `nullptr`.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e21af685e1828f7ca65038307df5cc06de4479e8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e21af685e1828f7ca65038307df5cc06de4479e8).\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
