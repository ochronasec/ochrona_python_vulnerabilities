An attacker who can upload attachments to\nthe wiki can use this to achieve remote code execution.\n\n### Patches\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nMoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is not advised to work around this, but to upgrade MoinMoin to a patched version.\n\nThat said, a work around via disabling the `cache` or the `AttachFile` action might be possible.\n\nAlso, it is of course helpful if you give `write` permissions (which include uploading attachments) only to trusted users.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Michael Chapman.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email me at [twaldmann@thinkmo.de](mailto:twaldmann@thinkmo.de).", "latest_version": "1.9.11", "language": "python", "license": "GPL-2.0-or-later", "repository_summary": "MoinMoin Wiki Development (2.0+), unstable, for production please use 1.9.x.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/moinwiki/moin", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 7.5, "cvss2_severity": "HIGH", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "NONE", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.9, "exploitability_score": 3.9, "cvss3_score": 9.8, "cvss3_severity": "CRITICAL", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 9.8}
