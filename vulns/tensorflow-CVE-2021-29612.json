An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in Eigen implementation of `tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve`. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278) calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the two tensors are not empty. Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing. This doesn't happen in this op's implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219), hence the validation that is present is also not effective. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in Eigen implementation of `tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n  \nmatrix_array = np.array([])\nmatrix_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(matrix_array,(0,1)),dtype=tf.float32)\nrhs_array = np.array([1,1])\nrhs_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(rhs_array,(1,2)),dtype=tf.float32)\ntf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve(matrix=matrix_tensor,rhs=rhs_tensor)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278) calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the two tensors are not empty:\n  \n```cc\nvoid ValidateInputTensors(OpKernelContext* ctx, const Tensor& in0, const Tensor& in1) {\n  OP_REQUIRES(\n      ctx, in0.dims() >= 2, \n      errors::InvalidArgument(\"In[0] ndims must be >= 2: \", in0.dims()));\n\n  OP_REQUIRES(\n      ctx, in1.dims() >= 2,\n      errors::InvalidArgument(\"In[1] ndims must be >= 2: \", in1.dims()));\n}\n``` \n\nFurthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing. This doesn't happen [in this op's implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219), hence the validation that is present is also not effective.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2) followed by GitHub commit [0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
