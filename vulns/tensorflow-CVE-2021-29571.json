    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L116-L130) assumes that the last element of `boxes` input is 4, as required by [the op](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/DrawBoundingBoxesV2). Since this is not checked attackers passing values less than 4 can write outside of bounds of heap allocated objects and cause memory corruption. If the last dimension in `boxes` is less than 4, accesses similar to `tboxes(b, bb, 3)` will access data outside of bounds. Further during code execution there are also writes to these indices. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimages = tf.fill([10, 96, 0, 1], 0.)\nboxes = tf.fill([10, 53, 0], 0.)\ncolors = tf.fill([0, 1], 0.)\n\ntf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2(images=images, boxes=boxes, colors=colors)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L116-L130) assumes that the last element of `boxes` input is 4, as required by [the op](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/DrawBoundingBoxesV2). Since this is not checked attackers passing values less than 4 can write outside of bounds of heap allocated objects and cause memory corruption:\n\n```cc \nconst auto tboxes = boxes.tensor<T, 3>();\nfor (int64 bb = 0; bb < num_boxes; ++bb) {\n  ...\n  const int64 min_box_row = static_cast<float>(tboxes(b, bb, 0)) * (height - 1);\n  const int64 max_box_row = static_cast<float>(tboxes(b, bb, 2)) * (height - 1);\n  const int64 min_box_col = static_cast<float>(tboxes(b, bb, 1)) * (width - 1);\n  const int64 max_box_col = static_cast<float>(tboxes(b, bb, 3)) * (width - 1);\n  ...\n}\n``` \n\nIf the last dimension in `boxes` is less than 4, accesses similar to `tboxes(b, bb, 3)` will access data outside of bounds. Further during code execution there are also writes to these indices.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.",
