    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`. Eigen code operating on an empty matrix can trigger on an assertion and will cause program termination. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`:\n    \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninputs = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)\nfft_length = tf.constant([0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.RFFT(input=inputs, fft_length=fft_length)\n```\n\nThe above example causes Eigen code to operate on an empty matrix. This triggers on an assertion and causes program termination.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions. \n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.",
