The implementation of `MatrixDiag*` operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4c4f420e68f1cfaf8f4b6e8e3eb857e9e4c3ff33/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L195-L197) does not validate that the tensor arguments are non-empty. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of [`MatrixDiag*` operations](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4c4f420e68f1cfaf8f4b6e8e3eb857e9e4c3ff33/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L195-L197) does not validate that the tensor arguments are non-empty:\n\n```cc\n      num_rows = context->input(2).flat<int32>()(0);\n      num_cols = context->input(3).flat<int32>()(0);\n      padding_value = context->input(4).flat<T>()(0); \n``` \n\nThus, users can trigger null pointer dereferences if any of the above tensors are null:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nd = tf.convert_to_tensor([],dtype=tf.float32)\np = tf.convert_to_tensor([],dtype=tf.float32)\ntf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV2(diagonal=d, k=0, num_rows=0, num_cols=0, padding_value=p)\n```\n\nChanging from `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV2` to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV3` still reproduces the issue.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a7116dd3913c4a4afd2a3a938573aa7c785fdfc6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a7116dd3913c4a4afd2a3a938573aa7c785fdfc6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
