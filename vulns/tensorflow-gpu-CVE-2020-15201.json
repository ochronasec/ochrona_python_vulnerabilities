In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor. Hence, the code is prone to heap buffer overflow. If `split_values` does not end with a value at least `num_values` then the `while` loop condition will trigger a read outside of the bounds of `split_values` once `batch_idx` grows too large. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor. Hence, this code is prone to heap buffer overflow:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L248-L251\n\nIf `split_values` does not end with a value at least `num_values` then the `while` loop condition will trigger a read outside of the bounds of `split_values` once `batch_idx` grows too large. \n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and will release a patch release.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 6.8, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "HIGH", "pr": "NONE", "c": "LOW", "i": "LOW", "a": "NONE", "impact_score": 2.5, "exploitability_score": 2.2, "cvss3_score": 4.8, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 4.8}
