    "description": "From NVD:\nAn issue was discovered in python-engineio through 3.8.2. There is a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability that allows attackers to make WebSocket connections to a server by using a victim's credentials, because the Origin header is not restricted.\nFrom Github:\n## WebSocket cross-origin vulnerability\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThis is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. It affects Socket.IO and Engine.IO web servers that authenticate clients using cookies.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\npython-engineio version 3.9.0 patches this vulnerability by adding server-side Origin header checks.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nDo not use cookies for client authentication, or else add a CSRF token to the connection URL.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\r\nhttps://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [python-engineio](http://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-engineio)\r\n\r\n",
