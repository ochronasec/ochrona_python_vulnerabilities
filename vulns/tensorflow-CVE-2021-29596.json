The implementation of the `EmbeddingLookup` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e4b29809543b250bc9b19678ec4776299dd569ba/tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup.cc#L73-L74). An attacker can craft a model such that the first dimension of the `value` input is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\nThe implementation of the `EmbeddingLookup` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e4b29809543b250bc9b19678ec4776299dd569ba/tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup.cc#L73-L74):\n\n```cc\nconst int row_size = SizeOfDimension(value, 0);\nconst int row_bytes = value->bytes / row_size;\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that the first dimension of the `value` input is 0.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
