    "description": "From NVD:\nFlask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the application you are protecting as a workaround.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nIf using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site.
