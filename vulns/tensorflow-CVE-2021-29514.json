If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nIf the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(splits=[7,8], values= [5, 16, 51, 76, 29, 27, 54, 95],\\\n                          size= 59, weights= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\\n                          binary_output=False)\n```\n\nThis will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the [implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446):\n    \n```cc \n    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {\n      while (idx >= splits(batch_idx)) {\n        batch_idx++;\n      }\n      ...\n      if (bin < size) {\n        if (binary_output_) {\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) = T(1);\n        } else {\n          T value = (weights_size > 0) ? weights(idx) : T(1);\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) += value;\n        }\n      } \n    }\n```\n\nBefore the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://www.tensorflow.org/", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.6, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "LOCAL", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.9, "exploitability_score": 1.8, "cvss3_score": 7.8, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.8}
