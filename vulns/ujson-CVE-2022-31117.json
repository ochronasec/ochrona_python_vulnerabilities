    "description": "From NVD:\nUltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with bindings for Python 3.7+. In versions prior to 5.4.0 an error occurring while reallocating a buffer for string decoding can cause the buffer to get freed twice. Due to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this double free is impossible to trigger from Python. This issue has been resolved in version 5.4.0 and all users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nWhen an error occurs while reallocating the buffer for string decoding, the buffer gets freed twice.\n\nDue to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this double free is impossible to trigger from Python.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nUsers should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThere is no workaround.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [UltraJSON](http://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues)\n",
