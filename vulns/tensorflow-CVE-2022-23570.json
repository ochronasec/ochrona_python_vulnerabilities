This is [guarded by a `DCHECK`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L104-L106):\n\n```cc\n  const auto* attr = attrs.Find(arg->s()); \n  DCHECK(attr != nullptr);\n  if (attr->value_case() == AttrValue::kList) {\n    // ...\n  }\n```\nHowever, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the assertion failure.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "latest_version": "2.8.0", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.0, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 2.8, "cvss3_score": 6.5, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 6.5}
