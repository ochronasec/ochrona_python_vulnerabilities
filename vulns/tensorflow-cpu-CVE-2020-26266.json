This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nUnder certain cases, a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution.

TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.\n\nSince this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.6, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "av": "LOCAL", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "LOW", "i": "LOW", "a": "LOW", "impact_score": 3.4, "exploitability_score": 1.8, "cvss3_score": 5.3, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 5.3}
