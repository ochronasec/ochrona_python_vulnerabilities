    "description": "From NVD:\nThe urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nUsers who are using an HTTPS proxy to issue HTTPS requests and haven't configured their own SSLContext via `proxy_config`.\nOnly the default SSLContext is impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\n[urllib3 >=1.26.4 has the issue resolved](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/1.26.4). urllib3<1.26 is not impacted due to not supporting HTTPS requests via HTTPS proxies.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading is recommended as this is a minor release and not likely to break current usage.\n\nConfiguring an `SSLContext` with `check_hostname=True` and passing via `proxy_config` instead of relying on the default `SSLContext`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [sethmichaellarson@gmail.com](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com)",
