    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedReshape` by passing in invalid thresholds for the quantization. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_reshape_op.cc#L38-L55) assumes that the 2 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric value directly. However, if any of these tensors is empty, then `.flat<T>()` is an empty buffer and accessing the element at position 0 results in overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedReshape` by passing in invalid thresholds for the quantization:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntensor = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.qint32)\nshape = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.int32)\ninput_min = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)\ninput_max = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.QuantizedReshape(tensor=tensor, shape=shape, input_min=input_min, input_max=input_max)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_reshape_op.cc#L38-L55) assumes that the 2 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric value directly:\n\n```cc\nconst auto& input_min_float_tensor = ctx->input(2);\n...\nconst float input_min_float = input_min_float_tensor.flat<float>()(0);\nconst auto& input_max_float_tensor = ctx->input(3);\n...\nconst float input_max_float = input_max_float_tensor.flat<float>()(0);\n```\n\nHowever, if any of these tensors is empty, then `.flat<T>()` is an empty buffer and accessing the element at position 0 results in overflow.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.",
