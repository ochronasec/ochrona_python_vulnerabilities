When using the browseable API viewer, Django REST Framework fails to properly escape certain strings that can come from user input. This allows a user who can control those strings to inject malicious <script> tags, leading to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\nFrom Github:\nA flaw was found in Django REST Framework versions before 3.12.0 and before 3.11.2.
