The implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact \nThe [implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273) can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n    \ntf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(\n  indices=[[1,1]],\n  values=[2],\n  dense_shape=[2 ** 31, 2 ** 32],\n  weights=[1],\n  binary_output=True,\n  minlength=-1,\n  maxlength=-1,\n  name=None)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
