    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d80ffba9702dc19d1fac74fc4b766b3fa1ee976b/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L376-L450) assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and last dimensions but does not check that this assumption is validated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\norig_input_shape = tf.constant([10, 6, 3, 7, 7], shape=[5], dtype=tf.int32)\ngrad = tf.constant([0.01, 0, 0], shape=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)\nksize = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\npadding = \"SAME\"\n\ntf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad(\n  orig_input_shape=orig_input_shape, grad=grad, ksize=ksize, strides=strides,\n  padding=padding)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d80ffba9702dc19d1fac74fc4b766b3fa1ee976b/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L376-L450) assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and last dimensions but does not check that this assumption is validated.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6fc9141f42f6a72180ecd24021c3e6b36165fe0d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6fc9141f42f6a72180ecd24021c3e6b36165fe0d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
