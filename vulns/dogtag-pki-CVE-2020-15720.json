Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.", "latest_version": "10.7.4", "language": "python", "license": "GPL-2.0-only", "repository_summary": "The Dogtag Certificate System is an enterprise-class open source Certificate Authority (CA).
