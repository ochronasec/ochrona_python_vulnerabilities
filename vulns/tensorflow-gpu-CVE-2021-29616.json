The implementation of TrySimplify(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/arithmetic_optimizer.cc#L390-L401) has undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer in corner cases that result in optimizing a node with no inputs. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of [`TrySimplify`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/arithmetic_optimizer.cc#L390-L401) has undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer in corner cases that\nresult in optimizing a node with no inputs.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e6340f0665d53716ef3197ada88936c2a5f7a2d3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e6340f0665d53716ef3197ada88936c2a5f7a2d3).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
