    "description": "From NVD:\nPySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature.\n\nThis is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document, but only the first it finds in the given scope.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nNo references provided at this point.\n\n### Credits\n\n- Victor Scho\u0308nfelder Garcia (isits AG International School of IT Security)\n- Juraj Somorovsky (Paderborn University)\n- Vladislav Mladenov (Ruhr University Bochum)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)",
