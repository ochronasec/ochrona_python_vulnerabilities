This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (TempPath will be C:\\Windows\\Temp). In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nLocal Privilege Escalation in all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode.\n\nThe vulnerability is present only on Windows and in this particular case: If a **software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode** is launched by a (privileged) user who has **his/her \"TempPath\" resolving to a world writable directory**. This is the case e.g. if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (in which case TempPath will default to C:\\Windows\\Temp).\n\nIn order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker has launched the exploit program. So for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).\n\nWhile PyInstaller itself was not vulnerable, all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode is vulnerable.\n\nCVSSv3 score 7.0 (High)\nCVSSv3 vector CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nAffected\n- all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode\n\nNo affected\n- PyInstaller itself (except if frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode on Windows)\n- software frozen in \"one*dir*\" mode\n- other platforms (GNU/Linux, OS X, BSD, etc.)\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is patched in commits 42a67148b3bdf9211fda8499fdc5b63acdd7e6cc (fixed code) and be948cf0954707671aa499da17b10c86b6fa5e5c (recompiled bootloaders). Users should upgrade to PyInstaller version 3.6 and rebuild their software.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround. Users using PyInstaller to freeze their Windows software using \"onefile\" mode should upgrade PyInstaller and rebuild their software.\n\n### Credits\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported by Farid AYOUJIL (@faridtsl), David HA, Florent LE NIGER and Yann GASCUEL (@lnv42) from Alter Solutions (@AlterSolutions) and fixed in collaboration with\nHartmut Goebel (@htgoebel, maintainer of PyInstaller).\n\n### Funding Development\n\nPyInstaller is in urgent need of funding to make future security fixes happen, see <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4404> for details.", "latest_version": "4.0", "language": "python", "license": "GPL-2.0-or-later", "repository_summary": "PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.4, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "LOCAL", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.9, "exploitability_score": 1.8, "cvss3_score": 7.8, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.8}
