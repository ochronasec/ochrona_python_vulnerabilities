    "description": "From NVD:\nFirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nWhen JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator to 1.0, or apply patch https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but it can be mitigated.\n\nIf you cannot upgrade yet, you can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until you can patch or upgrade.",
