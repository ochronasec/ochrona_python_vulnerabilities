    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later), session operations are invalid. However, users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer dereference. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5/tensorflow/core/kernels/session_ops.cc#L104) dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid. Thus, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of the member function is undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nIn eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later), session operations are invalid. However, users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer dereference:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor(handle=['\\x12\\x1a\\x07'],dtype=4)\n```\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.DeleteSessionTensor(handle=['\\x12\\x1a\\x07'])\n``` \n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5/tensorflow/core/kernels/session_ops.cc#L104) dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid:\n  \n```cc\n  OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->session_state()->GetTensor(name, &val));\n```\n\nThus, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of the member function is undefined behavior.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
