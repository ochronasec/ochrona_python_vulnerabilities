The following versions should be updated to as soon as possible:\n\nC# 3.0.2  \nD 3.0.1  \nDart 3.0.3  \nElixir 3.0.0  \nGo 3.0.1  \nJava 3.3.0  \nJavaScript 3.1.0  \nKotlin 1.1.0  \nLua 3.0.1  \nPHP 3.0.2  \nPerl 3.0.0  \nPython 3.0.2  \nRuby 3.0.1  \nRust 3.0.0  \nScala 3.0.1  \nSwift 1.0.1  \n\nIf you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the personnummer to be\n000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not\n000x.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Personnummer Meta](https://github.com/personnummer/meta/issues)\n* Email us at [Personnummer Email](mailto:security@personnummer.dev)\n\n### Credits\n\nNiklas Sk\u00f6ldmark (Medborgarskolan)", "latest_version": "3.0.2", "language": "python", "license": "MIT", "repository_summary": "Validate Swedish personal identity numbers", "repo_url": "http://github.com/personnummer/python", "impact": {"cvss3_score": null, "cvss3_severity": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "pr": null, "ui": null, "s": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "impact_score": null, "exploitability_score": null}, "ochrona_severity_score": 2}
