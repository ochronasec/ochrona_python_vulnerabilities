The implementation of `SparseTensorSliceDataset` has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a `nullptr` value. The 3 input arguments to `SparseTensorSliceDataset` represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact \nThe [implementation of `SparseTensorSliceDataset`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L227-L292) has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a `nullptr` value:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset(\n  indices=[[]],\n  values=[],\n  dense_shape=[1,1])\n```\n\nThe 3 input arguments represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [965b97e4a9650495cda5a8c210ef6684b4b9eceb](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/965b97e4a9650495cda5a8c210ef6684b4b9eceb).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
