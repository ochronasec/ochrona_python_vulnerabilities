Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.", "latest_version": "2.3.0", "language": "python", "license": "MIT", "repository_summary": "An interactive, command-line presentation tool", "repo_url": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme", "impact": {"cvss2_score": null, "cvss2_severity": null, "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.8, "exploitability_score": 2.8, "cvss3_score": 9.3, "cvss3_severity": "CRITCAL", "ui": "REQUIRED", "s": "CHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 9.3}
