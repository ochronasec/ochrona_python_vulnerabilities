Because py-terminal-banner is delivered as a wheel, it will not automatically execute malicious code during setup.py installation. However, upon executing the generate_banner function, py-terminal-banner will open a reverse shell and attempt, then attempt to read and write the user's AWS credentials to an IP located in Brazil.
