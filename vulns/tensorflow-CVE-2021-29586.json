Optimized pooling implementations in TFLite fail to check that the stride arguments are not 0 before calling `ComputePaddingHeightWidth`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f24ccd932546416ec906a02ddd183b48a1d2c83/tensorflow/lite/kernels/pooling.cc#L90). Since users can craft special models which will have `params->stride_{height,width}` be zero, this will result in a division by zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nOptimized pooling implementations in TFLite fail to check that the stride arguments are not 0 before calling [`ComputePaddingHeightWidth`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f24ccd932546416ec906a02ddd183b48a1d2c83/tensorflow/lite/kernels/pooling.cc#L90).\n\nSince users can craft special models which will have `params->stride_{height,width}` be zero, this will result in a division by zero.\n                          \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc).\n      \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
