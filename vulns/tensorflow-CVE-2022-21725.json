The estimator for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a division by 0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is strictly positive. Hence, the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact \nThe [estimator for the cost of some convolution operations](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ffa202a17ab7a4a10182b746d230ea66f021fe16/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc#L189-L198) can be made to execute a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function\ndef test():\n  y=tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad(\n    orig_input_shape=[1,1,1,1],\n    grad=[[[[1.0],[1.0],[1.0]]],[[[2.0],[2.0],[2.0]]],[[[3.0],[3.0],[3.0]]]],\n    ksize=[1,1,1,1],\n    strides=[1,1,1,0],\n    padding='VALID',\n    data_format='NCHW')\n  return y\n\ntest()\n```\n\nThe function fails to check that the stride argument is stricly positive:\n\n```cc\nint64_t GetOutputSize(const int64_t input, const int64_t filter,\n                      const int64_t stride, const Padding& padding) {\n  // Logic for calculating output shape is from GetWindowedOutputSizeVerbose() \n  // function in third_party/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc.\n  if (padding == Padding::VALID) {\n    return (input - filter + stride) / stride;\n  } else {  // SAME.\n    return (input + stride - 1) / stride;\n  }\n} \n```\n\nHence, the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3218043d6d3a019756607643cf65574fbfef5d7a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3218043d6d3a019756607643cf65574fbfef5d7a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "latest_version": "2.8.0", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.0, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 2.8, "cvss3_score": 6.5, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 6.5}
