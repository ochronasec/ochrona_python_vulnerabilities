This can cause a denial of service in products using `tensorflow-serving` or other inference-as-a-service installments. Fixed were added in commits f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968 and fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d (both going into TensorFlow 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 but not yet backported to earlier versions). However, this was not enough, as #41097 reports a different failure mode. The issue is patched in commit adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 5.0, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "NONE", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 3.9, "cvss3_score": 7.5, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.5}
