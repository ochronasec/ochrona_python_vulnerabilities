The implementation of the `DepthwiseConv` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1a8e885b864c818198a5b2c0cbbeca5a1e833bc8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L287-L288). An attacker can craft a model such that `input`'s fourth dimension would be 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe implementation of the `DepthwiseConv` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1a8e885b864c818198a5b2c0cbbeca5a1e833bc8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L287-L288):\n\n```cc\nint num_input_channels = SizeOfDimension(input, 3);\nTF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ(context, num_filter_channels % num_input_channels, 0);\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that `input`'s fourth dimension would be 0.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cbda3c6b2dbbd3fbdc482ff8c0170a78ec2e97d0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cbda3c6b2dbbd3fbdc482ff8c0170a78ec2e97d0).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
