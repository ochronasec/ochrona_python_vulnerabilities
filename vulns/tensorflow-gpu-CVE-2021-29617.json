An attacker can cause a denial of service via `CHECK`-fail in `tf.strings.substr` with invalid arguments. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service via `CHECK`-fail in  `tf.strings.substr` with invalid arguments:\n\n```python \nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,-1])\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,2])\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit [890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
