    "description": "From NVD:\nTensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `GetInitOp` is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nThe [implementation of `GetInitOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader_util.cc#L31-L61) is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null pointer:\n\n```cc\nconst auto& init_op_sig_it =\n    meta_graph_def.signature_def().find(kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey);\nif (init_op_sig_it != sig_def_map.end()) {\n  *init_op_name = init_op_sig_it->second.outputs()\n                      .find(kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey)\n                      ->second.name();\n  return Status::OK();\n}\n```\n\nHere, we have a nested map and we assume that if the first `.find` succeeds then so would be the search in the internal map. However, the maps are built based on the `SavedModel` protobuf format and a malicious user can alter that on disk before loading to cause the second `.find` to return `nullptr`.\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [4f38b1ac8e42727e18a2f0bde06d3bee8e77b250](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4f38b1ac8e42727e18a2f0bde06d3bee8e77b250).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.",
