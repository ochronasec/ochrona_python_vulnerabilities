After `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)` gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified state. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nA malicious user can cause a use after free behavior when [decoding PNG images](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/decode_image_op.cc#L339-L346):\n```cc\nif (/* ... error conditions ... */) {\n  png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode);\n  OP_REQUIRES(context, false,\n              errors::InvalidArgument(\"PNG size too large for int: \",\n                                      decode.width, \" by \", decode.height));\n}   \n```\nAfter `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)` gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified state.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e746adbfcfee15e9cfdb391ff746c765b99bdf9b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e746adbfcfee15e9cfdb391ff746c765b99bdf9b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
