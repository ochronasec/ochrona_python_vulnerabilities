The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.", "latest_version": "2.8", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. https://cryptography.io/", "repo_url": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 5.0, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "NONE", "c": "HIGH", "i": "NONE", "a": "NONE", "impact_score": 3.6, "exploitability_score": 3.9, "cvss3_score": 7.5, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.5}
