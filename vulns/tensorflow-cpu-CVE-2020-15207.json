However, the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out of bounds which results in segfaults and/or data corruption. The issue is patched in commit 2d88f470dea2671b430884260f3626b1fe99830a, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 6.8, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "HIGH", "pr": "NONE", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 6.0, "exploitability_score": 2.2, "cvss3_score": 9.0, "cvss3_severity": "CRITICAL", "ui": "NONE", "s": "CHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 9.0}
