Such commands allowed for example to read local files (e.g. `indico.conf`).\r\n\r\nAs far as we know it is not possible to write files or execute code using this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nYou need to update to [Indico 2.2.3](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.2.3) as soon as possible.\r\nWe also released [Indico 2.1.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.1.10) in case you cannot update to 2.2 for some reason.\r\nSee https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/ for instructions on how to update.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nSetting `XELATEX_PATH = None` in `indico.conf` will result in an error when building a PDF, but without being able to run xelatex, the vulnerability cannot be abused.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\r\n* Email us privately at [indico-team@cern.ch](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch)\r\n\n", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "MIT", "repository_summary": "Indico is a full-featured conference lifecycle management and meeting/lecture scheduling tool", "repo_url": "https://github.com/indico/indico", "impact": {"cvss3_score": null, "cvss3_severity": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "pr": null, "ui": null, "s": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "impact_score": null, "exploitability_score": null}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7}
