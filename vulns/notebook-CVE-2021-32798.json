    "description": "From NVD:\nThe Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim computer using Jupyter APIs.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\n\nUntrusted notebook can execute code on load. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.\n\n### Patches\n\n5.7.11, 6.4.1\n\n### References\n\n[OWASP Page on Injection Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#injection-prevention-rules)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list security@ipython.org.\n\nCredit: Guillaume Jeanne from Google",
