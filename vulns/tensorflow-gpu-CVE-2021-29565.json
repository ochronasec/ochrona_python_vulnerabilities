If the `dense_shape` tensor is empty, then `dense_shape_t.vec<>()` would cause a null pointer dereference in the implementation of the op:\n\n```cc\ntemplate <typename T, typename Tindex>\nstruct SparseFillEmptyRows<CPUDevice, T, Tindex> {\n  Status operator()(OpKernelContext* context, const Tensor& default_value_t,\n                    const Tensor& indices_t, const Tensor& values_t,\n                    const Tensor& dense_shape_t,\n                    typename AsyncOpKernel::DoneCallback done) {\n    ...\n    const auto dense_shape = dense_shape_t.vec<Tindex>();\n    ... \n  }\n}\n``` \n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [faa76f39014ed3b5e2c158593b1335522e573c7f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/faa76f39014ed3b5e2c158593b1335522e573c7f).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
