    "description": "### Impact\n\nIf you use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target.\n\nThis includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials.\n\nIf you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the [`w3lib.http.basic_auth_header`](https://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.http.basic_auth_header) function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues)\n* [Email us](mailto:opensource@zyte.com)\n",
