An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/988087bd83f144af14087fe4fecee2d250d93737/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc#L261-L263) does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nfilter = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\n\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1]\npadding = \"SAME\"\n                               \ntf.raw_ops.Conv2D(input=input, filter=filter, strides=strides, padding=padding)\n```                            \n                               \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/988087bd83f144af14087fe4fecee2d250d93737/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc#L261-L263) does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller:\n```cc\n  const int64 patch_depth = filter.dim_size(2);\n  if (in_depth % patch_depth != 0) { ... }\n```\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b12aa1d44352de21d1a6faaf04172d8c2508b42b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b12aa1d44352de21d1a6faaf04172d8c2508b42b).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
