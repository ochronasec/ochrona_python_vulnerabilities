An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/699bff5d961f0abfde8fa3f876e6d241681fbef8/tensorflow/core/util/sparse/sparse_tensor.h#L528-L530) accesses an array element based on a user controlled offset. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nshape_dims = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int64)\nindices = tf.ones([1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)\nvalues = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)\nshape = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseSplit(\n    split_dim=shape_dims, indices=indices, values=values,\n    shape=shape, num_split=1)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/699bff5d961f0abfde8fa3f876e6d241681fbef8/tensorflow/core/util/sparse/sparse_tensor.h#L528-L530) accesses an array element based on a user controlled offset:\n\n```cc\nconst int dim = input_tensor.indices().matrix<int64>()(i, split_dim);\nint slice_index = GetSliceIndex(dim, split_size, residual);\nnum_values[slice_index]++;\n```\n\nThis results in overriding values on the heap.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
