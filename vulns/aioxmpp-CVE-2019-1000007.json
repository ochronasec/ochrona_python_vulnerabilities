This attack appears to be exploitable via Remote. A crafted stanza can be sent to an application which uses the vulnerable components to either inject data in a different context or cause the application to reconnect (potentially losing data). This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 0.10.3.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nPossible remote Denial of Service or Data Injection.\n\n### Patches\nPatches are available in https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp/pull/268. They have been backported to the 0.10 release series and 0.10.3 is the first release to contain the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo make the bug exploitable, an error suppressing ``xso_error_handler`` is required. By not using ``xso_error_handlers`` or not using the suppression function, the vulnerability can be mitigated completely (to our knowledge).\n\n### References\nThe pull request contains a detailed description: https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp/pull/268\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Join our chat](xmpp:aioxmpp@conference.zombofant.net?join)\n* Email the maintainer [Jonas Sch\u00e4fer](mailto:jonas@wielicki.name)", "latest_version": "0.11.0", "language": "python", "license": "LGPL-3.0-or-later", "repository_summary": "Pure-python XMPP library for asyncio", "repo_url": "https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 5.8, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "HIGH", "pr": "NONE", "c": "NONE", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.2, "exploitability_score": 2.2, "cvss3_score": 7.4, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 7.4}
