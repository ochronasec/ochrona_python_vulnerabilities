    "description": "From NVD:\nparlai is a framework for training and evaluating AI models on a variety of openly available dialogue datasets. In affected versions the package is vulnerable to YAML deserialization attack caused by unsafe loading which leads to Arbitary code execution. This security bug is patched by avoiding unsafe loader users should update to version above v1.1.0. If upgrading is not possible then users can change the Loader used to SafeLoader as a workaround. See commit 507d066ef432ea27d3e201da08009872a2f37725 for details.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nDue to use of unsafe YAML deserialization logic, an attacker with the ability to modify local YAML configuration files could provide malicious input, resulting in remote code execution or similar risks.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue can be patched by upgrading to v1.1.0 or later. It can also be patched by replacing YAML deserialization with equivalent safe_load calls.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/commit/507d066ef432ea27d3e201da08009872a2f37725\n- https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/commit/4374fa2aba383db6526ab36e939eb1cf8ef99879\n- https://anon-artist.github.io/blogs/blog3.html",
