An attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`.

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nAn attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_values = tf.constant([58], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)\ninput_splits = tf.constant([[81, 101, 0]], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int32)\noutput_encoding = \"UTF-8\"\n\ntf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode(\n    input_values=input_values, input_splits=input_splits,\n    output_encoding=output_encoding)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/472c1f12ad9063405737679d4f6bd43094e1d36d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc)\nassumes that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair specify a valid sparse tensor.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
