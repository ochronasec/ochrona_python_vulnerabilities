An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would allow limited reads and writes outside of arrays in TFLite. This exploits missing validation in the conversion from sparse tensors to dense tensors.

This exploits missing validation in [the conversion from sparse tensors to dense tensors](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ca6f96b62ad84207fbec580404eaa7dd7403a550/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/utils/sparsity_format_converter.cc#L252-L293).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6364463d6f5b6254cac3d6aedf999b6a96225038](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6364463d6f5b6254cac3d6aedf999b6a96225038).\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Wang Xuan of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "latest_version": "2.8.0", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 6.5, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "HIGH", "i": "HIGH", "a": "HIGH", "impact_score": 5.9, "exploitability_score": 2.8, "cvss3_score": 8.8, "cvss3_severity": "HIGH", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 8.8}
