The issue occurs because the `status` argument during validation failures is not properly checked. Since each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value must be checked before continuing. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\nFrom Github:\n### Impact\nIf a user passes a list of strings to `dlpack.to_dlpack` there is a memory leak following an expected validation failure:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L100-L104\n\nThe allocated memory is from\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L256\n\nThe issue occurs because the `status` argument during validation failures is not properly checked:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L265-L267\n\nSince each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value must be checked before continuing.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and will release a patch release for all affected versions.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.2.1 or 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been discovered during variant analysis of [GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v).", "latest_version": "2.3.1", "language": "python", "license": "Apache-2.0", "repository_summary": "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for everyone.", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "impact": {"cvss2_score": 4.0, "cvss2_severity": "MEDIUM", "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "av": "NETWORK", "ac": "LOW", "pr": "LOW", "c": "NONE", "i": "NONE", "a": "LOW", "impact_score": 1.4, "exploitability_score": 2.8, "cvss3_score": 4.3, "cvss3_severity": "MEDIUM", "ui": "NONE", "s": "UNCHANGED"}, "ochrona_severity_score": 4.3}
